Energy function as stopping condition delta e or delta y
	Use the delta y is equal to zero

What is equilibrium as described in the Bam net
	Typically where the y and x are not changing very much
	How much x layer and y layer changin wit respect to each other
	Can be an implementation specific

Hopfield update rule vs BAM rule 
	xi + sum(xw)
	sum(xw)
	Run hopfield for initial input
	Set target values based on input
	Ysubi is xsubi first time through
	Next time through you don't have the xsubi

Batch versus one by one
	Current understanding is broadcast vs update all independently below a certain variance
	Randomization is characteristic of the algorithm
		Prevent the net from converging to a bad solution
	Batch would mess up the hopfield
	Batch one unit
	Plug all Xi's into a matrix, element wise multiply, sum thru the rows

BAM net update in random, sequential, or batch mode
	batch no shared information

Delayed midterm
	
Submission hierarchy
	Single zip file
